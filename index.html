     How do I get my sevrer advertised?
    </h2>
    <h4>
      To get your server on our server you need to first fill out the advertisement application and submit it. You then need to join the discord and notify me, Bacon(The Owner), that you have filled out the application and I will go and check it out when I have time.
    </h4>
    <h2 id="heading">
      How will I know if my application was accepted?
    </h2>
    <h4>
      I will notify you on discord if your application was accepted or denied. If your application is denied I will notify you along with the reason for denial and I will reset your application so you can try again.
    </h4>
    <h2 id="heading">
      Is there a premium membership?
    </h2>
    <h4>
      No. We are a free service but there will be an in-game currency that you can use to buy various perks. 
    </h4>
    <h2 id="heading">
      Is there anything else on the server?
    </h2>
    <h4>
      YES! We have SkyBlock which is where you will get money to buy the server perks. We also will have some events that will give extra money!
    </h4>
    <h5 style="font-style:italic;">
      Even though we are not a Mini-Game/Survival/a normal server please remember that we still have rules that must be followed to keep advertisement rights.
