      History Of The Server
    </h2>
    <h4>
      We started out as an Event server hosted on a site called aternos. We went through many different phases on this host but edned up leaving it becasue of it's need for user input to run. We then found GameHosting.gg and started using them for the server. We attempted to be a surival server but found out that the PocketMineMp softeware wasn't designed to do that. We then moved on to a SkyBlock server and was that way for a while. Since school started for the owner He has decided to make it a Gateway server for others to benifit off of. He aslo created this site that you are using right now.
